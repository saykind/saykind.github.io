We study the Landau levels of a Weyl semimetal with two adjacent Weyl nodes. We consider different orientations of magnetic field with respect to the vector of Weyl node splitting. A magnetic field facilitates the tunneling between the nodes, giving rise to a gap in the transverse energy of the zeroth Landau level. We show how the spectrum is rearranged at different orientations and how this manifests itself in the change of behavior of the differential magnetoconductance of a ballistic p-n junction.
