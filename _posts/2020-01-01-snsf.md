When student starts to work in [SNSF](https://snsf.stanford.edu/facilities/fab/npc) cleanroom, he has to take a quiz to get access. In theory, it should be possible to answer the questions after reading provided manual, but in practice it is not possible. I used Python package called [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) to brute-force the quiz and now I share the answers to save you some time.
