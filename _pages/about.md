I am a sixth-year PhD student in Physics at Stanford University in the group of Professor [Aharon Kapitulnik](https://kapitulnik.stanford.edu), where I use high–resolution optical Kerr effect measurements to study quantum materials, including novel semimetals, two-dimensional devices, and unconventional superconductors.

Prior to beginning my PhD track, I received a Masters degree from Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Theoretical Physics (GPA: 3.7) and Bachelor’s degree from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in Applied Physics (GPA: 3.9).
