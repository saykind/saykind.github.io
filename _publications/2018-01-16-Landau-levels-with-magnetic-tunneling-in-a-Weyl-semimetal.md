We study the Landau levels (LLs) of a Weyl semimetal with two adjacent Weyl nodes. We consider different orientations of magnetic field. A magnetic field facilitates the tunneling between the nodes, giving rise to a gap in the transverse energy of the zeroth LL. We show how the spectrum is rearranged at different angles and how this manifests itself in the change of behavior of the differential magnetoconductance of a ballistic p-n junction. Unlike the single-cone model where Klein tunneling reveals itself in positive differential magnetoconductance.
