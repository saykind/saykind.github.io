Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in UTe2 was inferred from observations of a spontaneous Kerr response in the superconducting state after cooling in zero magnetic field, while a finite c-axis magnetic field training was further used to determine the nature of the nonunitary composite order parameter of this material. Here, we present an extensive study of the magnetic-field-trained Kerr effect, which unveils a unique critical state of pinned “ferromagnetic vortices.” We show that a remanent Kerr signal appears following the removal of a training magnetic field, which reflects the response to the TRSB order parameter and the external magnetic field through the paramagnetic susceptibility. This unambiguously demonstrates the importance of the magnetic fluctuations and their intimate relation to the composite order parameter. Focusing the beam on the center of the sample, we are able to accurately determine the maximum field that is screened by the critical state and the respective critical current. Measurements in the presence of magnetic field show the tendency of the superconductor to produce shielding currents that oppose the increase in vortex-induced magnetization due to the diverging paramagnetic susceptibility.
